all questions asked by five watch experts amazed the judge
five or six big jet planes zoomed quickly by the tower
six of the women quietly gave back prizes to the judge
ban foul toxic smogs which quickly jeopardize lives
the jukebox music puzzled a gentle visitor from a quaint valley town
the public was amazed to view the quickness and dexterity of the juggler
my faxed joke won a pager in the cable tv quiz show
how razorback jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts
by jove my quick study of lexicography won a prize
a large fawn jumped quickly over white zinc boxes
cozy lummox gives smart squid who asks for job pen
adjusting quiver and bow zompyc killed the fox
the quick onyx goblin jumps over the lazy dwarf
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
the jay pig fox zebra and my wolves quack
